* saythanks

A Clojure library designed to thank people who wish you on Facebook on
your birthday. You can see an image of it in action here:

** Pre-requisites

You need to install Redis in order to use this code. We need Redis to
store the point to which we've replied to posts. This allows us keep
continuously polling Facebook and reply to everyone who wishes us.

** Usage

1. Create the file src/saythankyou/access.clj

Add the following code to it:

    (ns saythanks.access)
    (def access-token "<your access token>")

Add your access token here.
Get it from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer
you need to give the read_stream and publish_actions
permissions. (under Extended Permissions)

2. Change the default thank-you messages in src/saythanks/core.clj

(If you wish, I think the defaults are quite good.)
A thank-you message will be picked at random and used to reply to the
facebook post.

3. Go to the terminal and run:

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar ./target/saythanks-0.2.0-standalone.jar

Enjoy :)

** Contribution

Suggestions and pull requests are most welcome.

Here are some TODO's I have in mind:

1. People try to break automated systems all the time.
   Filter out the posts with bad words in them, using
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt, and delete
   these posts.
